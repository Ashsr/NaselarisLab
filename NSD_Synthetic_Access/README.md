# NSD Synthetic Access

This is a derived class from [NSD Access](https://github.com/tknapen/nsd_access) \
Please install the above tool to use NSD Synthetic Access. \
It is tailored to read in and play with the NSD Synthetic Data. \
It has the same functionality as NSD Access and an additional `stim_indexing` function to return stimulus indexing information for the betas in the session. \
The [sample Jupyter Notebook](./Tryout_local_NSDSAccess.ipynb) which demonstrates the usage has been added here. \
Please Note: The path for the behavioral responses files have not been added yet.
